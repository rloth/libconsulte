09/19/02   Allowed %FONTCHG; within PROD, COMPANY and BRANDNAME to accomodate changes in text display.
08/27/02   Added new SUBCAT ID "prog" for "Progress" articles in Nature Materials.
08/20/02   Added the attribute "extrefid" to the element CITE for citations that refer to articles that share a page with other articles. Because the automatic link creation process is based largely on cited page numbers, the builder can't identify which article the citation is referring to when more than one article exists on that page. In these cases, the builder will generate a messsage reporting the ambiguous citation and the electronic  production can then supply the UID of the target article as the value of the extrefid attribute.
08/20/02   Changed attribute "nmatcode" to "code" as these subjects will not be used exclusively for Nature Materials and 
	   may appear in future titles.
08/20/02   Added new CATEG ID "ethicsw" for "Ethics Watch" category in Nature Reviews Genetics.
08/14/02   Added new CATEG ID "thismo" for "This Month" category which will appear in Nature Materials.
07/19/02   Added the new element SUBJECT to PUBFM and SUPPFM to accomodate Nature Materials "subjects". SUBJECT contains 		   NMATCODE attribute with possible numerical values of 1-30 which are translated by the HTML builders to the 	   	   appropriate subject heading:

		nmatcode-1 = Metals & alloy
		nmatcode-2 = Ceramics
		nmatcode-3 = Composites
		nmatcode-4 = Glasses
		nmatcode-5 = Colloids
		nmatcode-6 = Liquid crystals
		nmatcode-7 = Polymers
		nmatcode-8 = Complex fluids
		nmatcode-9 = Biological materials
		nmatcode-10 = Biomedical materials
		nmatcode-11 = Structural materials
		nmatcode-12 = Electronic materials
		nmatcode-13 = Molecular electronics
		nmatcode-14 = Semiconductors
		nmatcode-15 = Optical, photonic and optoelectronic materials
		nmatcode-16 = Magnetic materials
		nmatcode-17 = Superconductors
		nmatcode-18 = Geomaterials 
		nmatcode-19 = Mechanical properties
		nmatcode-20 = Granular materials and particle technology
		nmatcode-21 = Catalytic materials
		nmatcode-22 = Separation materials
		nmatcode-23 = Sensors and biosensors
		nmatcode-24 = Materials for energy
		nmatcode-25 = Nanoscale materials 
		nmatcode-26 = Porous materials 
		nmatcode-27 = Surface and thin films
		nmatcode-28 = Design synthesis and processing
		nmatcode-29 = Characterisation and analytical techniques
		nmatcode-30 = Computation, modelling and theory

07/18/02   	Created new element KEYWORDGRP for keywords within Nature materials articles. These keywords will be used for web 
	   	searches and transferred to META tags upon HTML translation. KEYWORDGRP is made up of one or more KEYWORD and is 		   optionally allowed within PUBFM and SUPPFM.
07/18/02   	Added the following new id to %SUBCAT; for repeatedly used subcategory in Nature Materials: matwit ("Materials 		   Witness")

07/09/02   	Added the following new ids to %CATEG for repeatedly used categories: bks (Book Review), brn (Business and 
	   	Regulatory News), highlts (Highlights), natview (Naureview), iniss (In this Issue), trialw (Trial Watch), 
	   	stw (Structure Watch), pw (Patent Watch), couch (From the Analyst's Couch), hyp (Hypothesis), ru (Round-up), 
		pa (Poster Abstracts), nf (News Feature).
	        Added the following new ids to %SUBCAT for repeatedly used sub categories: an (Analysis), fc (Fool's Corner), 
		ib (In Brief), nm (New On the Market)
07/03/02   	Created new elements COMPANY, PROD and BRANDNAME within %DATA; to facilitate Bio Compare linking 		project.COMPANY requires "id" atttribute which acts as target for required "companyid" attribute on PROD.
06/12/02   	Created new attribute TYPE on element ISSN. Possible values are "electronic" and "print". Made ISSN 'one or 
		more' 
	   	within PUBFM, PARENT and PUBINFO. Changes were made to support "dual issn's" - print and electronic - 		currently being used for the Reviews and eventually the Research titles and Nature.
05/29/02 	All default attribute values were quoted as per XML requirements.
		
		XML does not support tag minimizations (Unclosed start-tags, Unclosed end-tags etc.) All instances of "- -" "- o" "o o" "o -" were removed.
		XML does not support NUMBER(S), NUTOKEN, CDATAS and NAME type attribute values. These were all replaced with CDATA.
		
		XML does not support SDATA entitities. SDATA removed from Nataminc SGML Entities
		
		XML does not support inline comments within an entity declaration. Inline comments were placed outside in external comments.
		
		XML does not support Exclusion models. E.g. In the CalsTbl.dtd: <!ELEMENT table (%tabl;)   -(table) >. All Exclusions were removed.
		
		Processing instruction <?SDATRANS> was removed as XML requires default attributes to be a literal value.
		
		XML does not allow spaces within attribute values as within the SDAFORM, SDARULE, SDAPREF, SDASUFF, SDASUSP attributes in ISO Math dtd. Any spaces were removed. Commented out definitions and uses of SDAFORM, SDARULE, SDAPREF, SDASUFF, SDASUSP as they are not used for NPG
		
		XML imposes rules on Mixed Content Models. #PCDATA must occur first in list of unordered elements. Revised mixed content models accordingly.
		
		XML syntax for defining parameter entities for elements cannot contain parenthesis. Parenthesis removed.
