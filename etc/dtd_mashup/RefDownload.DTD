		<Abstract>An overview of the most outstanding aspects of microdialysis (MD) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) separately, but especially the promising trend of their off and on-line coupling is presented here. The interfaces required and the main advantages of MD-CE arrangements as compared with those used in MD-HPLC are emphasized as well as key applications of MD-CE in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and neuroscience.

		<Abstract>The analytical performance of coupled volatile species generation-integrated atom trap (VSG-IAT) atomizer flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) system was evaluated for determination of Cd and Pb in reference materials. Lead using formation of PbH
			<inf>4</inf> and Cd
			<sup>0</sup> vapors are atomized in air-acetylene flame-heated IAT. A new design of VSG-IAT-FAAS hyphenated technique that would exceed the operational capabilities of existing arrangements (a water-cooled single silica tube, double-slotted quartz tube or an &ldquo;integrated trap&rdquo;) was investigated. A dramatic improvement in detection limit was achieved compared with that obtained using either of the above atom trapping techniques separately. The concentration detection limits, defined as 3 times the blank standard deviation (3&sigma;), were 0.05 and 0.40 ng mL
			<sup>&minus;1</sup> for Cd and Pb, respectively. For a 120 s in situ pre-concentration time, sensitivity enhancement compared to flame AAS, was 500 and 575 folds for Cd and Pb, respectively, using volatile species generator-atom trapping technique. The sensitivity can be further improved by increasing the collection time. The precision, expressed as RSD, was 4.4% and 4.1% (
			<it>n</it> = 6) for Cd and Pb, respectively. The designs studied include slotted tube, single silica tube and integrated atom trap-cooled atom traps. The accuracy of method was verified using certified reference materials (PLANTS 3 and IAEA/W-4) by standard additional calibration technique. The measured Cd and Pb contents in two reference materials were in satisfactory agreement with the certified values.
